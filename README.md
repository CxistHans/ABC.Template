# ABC.Template

This repository is a sample of [dotnet-templating](https://github.com/dotnet/templating).

## What does this sample want to do

While your work involves many *similar* solution items or projects, **creating a dotnet template** will be pretty useful.

The sample has two projects which mainly contains an `ITemplateLogService` and a `TemplateLogService`. If a similar solution is required to be created, for example, with an `IExceptionLogService` and an `ExceptionLogService`, I want to show you how to generate the solution in fast with dotnet-templating.

## Preparation

* .NET Core, 3.0+

* Visual Studio 2019, 16.3+

## Instruction

1. Clone this repository and open the solution with Visual Studio;

2. Copy the directory path;
